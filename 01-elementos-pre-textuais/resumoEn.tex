        In many companies we have a certain lack when the subject is automation of tests or web processes in browsers.
        The need for regression testing, functionality testing, and / or process automation grows along with the system,
        but the practice of these activities is only strong when a need or problem appears.

        This new framework aims to bring users an easy-to-use tool with useful resources for the development of these
        tasks, with the ease and versatility of the python language and the integration with browsers with selenium framework.

        The sets of tools that the framework has are: automatic management of the drivers of navigators (drivers), module of
        reports and logs to control activities performed, standardization of creation of screen elements using the standard
        PageObject and identification of layout change.
