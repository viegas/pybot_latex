        Currently, many companies lack a solution for  test automation or web process management integrated to the browsers.
        The need for regression testing, functionality testing, and / or process automation grows along with the system,
        but the practice of these activities is only emerge when a need or problem appears.

        In order to solve this problem, we propose a framework aims to present to  users an easy-to-use tool with useful resources for the development of these
        tasks, with the simplicity and versatility of the \emph{Python} language and the integration with browsers with \emph{selenium framework}.

        The sets of tools that the proposed framework presents are: automatic management of the drivers of navigators (\emph{drivers}); module containing reports
        and logs to control activities performed; standardization of screen elements development using the standard \emph{PageObject} and identification of layout change.
